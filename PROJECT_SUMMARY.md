This Intelligent Headlight Control System automates High/Low beam switching based on real-time traffic distance to prevent glare.
It enhances safety during overtaking by triggering synchronized 2Hz beam flashing and horn pulses to alert other drivers.
The system instantly detects critical events like engine stalls or blocking vehicles, activating hazard lights or warning pulses immediately.
Designed as a modular logic engine, it processes camera and radar data to control physical vehicle actuators for optimal road safety.
